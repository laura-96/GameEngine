# GameEngine

GameEngine is a 3D Game Engine developed as a project for Video Games Engine subject in UPC's centre, CITM.

It currently functions as a scene viewer. 3d models are loaded in a scene where it is possible to navigate throug keyboard (asdw). These models must be saved on Assets/ directory, and its textures, to the Textures/ one.
The editor shows game objects' hierarchy, which can be modified through a panel that will appear by selecting them on the hierarchy window.

GameEngine doesn't allow multitexturing at the moment.
