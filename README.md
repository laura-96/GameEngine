# GameEngine

GameEngine is a 3D Game Engine developed as a project for Video Games Engine subject in UPC's centre, CITM.

It currently functions as a scene viewer. 3d models are loaded in a scene where it is possible to navigate throug keyboard (asdw). These models must be saved on Assets/ directory, and its textures, to the Textures/ one.
The editor shows game objects' hierarchy, which can be modified through a panel that will appear by selecting them on the hierarchy window.

If in File menu Save is selected, the current scene will be save. To load it, Load option must be selected. To create a game object in game, click on right button anywhere in the screen and an option panel will appear.

GameEngine doesn't allow multitexturing at the moment.
